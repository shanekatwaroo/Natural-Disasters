# Results

## Here are the SQL query results for the KPI's analyzed:

**1.) Which countries(top 5)has had the largest amount of natural disasters?**
- From this query, it is clear that the countries with the most natural disasters seem to be the United States and China. Both countries have over 900 occurences of natural disasters in the last 50 years. 


**2.) What is the most common type of natural disaster?**
The most common type of natural disaster are floods. In the last 50 years, there have been over 5000 floods around the world. The least common type of disaster seems to be landslides. This makes sense as landslides tend to occur as a result of other disasters such as earthquakes, which come in at about 1000 occurences.


**3.) Have the amount of natural disasters increased over the years?**
From this query, it is clear that there is no distinct trend as to the amount of natural disasters occuring since 1970. However, it does seem like the amount of disasters in the early 2000's are much higher than any other year.


**4.) Which type of natural disaster is considered the deadliest?**
This query shows that storm's seem to be the deadliest natural disaster, with over 30,000 deaths since 1970!


**5.) What type of natural disaster is most common based on country?**
It seems that storms and floods are the most common type of natural disasters among the countries listed in KPI 1. This could definitely be due to the fact that these countries are not surrounded by other countries, instead they are surrounded by water which has a big effect on storms and floods.


**6.) Which region of the world is most affected by natural disasters?**
When dealing with regions, there doesn't seem to be a clear distinction as to which region suffers the most from natural disasters. However, the southern part of Asia seems to have the most natural disasters. 


**7.) What type of natural disaster costed the most in terms of damage?**
This is an interesting result. I expected storms or floods to have the most damage in terms of cost, being that they are the most frequently occuring disaster. However, it seems that earthquakes cost a lot more than any other natural disaster. Now that I think about it, this does make sense, being that earthquakes can cause severe damage to buildings.
